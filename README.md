Hello! My name is Mira Arguelles.

:fish: I study fish methylomes at the Philippine Genome Center - Program for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Forestry under the **Tawilis Multi-omics Project**.
:cow: :pig: :mouse: For my thesis, I looked into the performance of different bisulfite sequencing analysis tools using real and simulated datasets of cattle, pig, and mouse.
While writing this I discovered that cows are female cattle (since there was a \:cow\: emoji but no cattle emoji).
I thought they were different animals. I studied computer science so I hope I get a free pass on this.

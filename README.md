Hello! My name is Mira Arguelles.

:fish: I study fish methylomes at the Philippine Genome Center - Program for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Forestry under the **Tawilis Multi-omics Project**.

\:cow\: \:pig\: \:mouse\: For my thesis, I looked into the performance of different bisulfite sequencing analysis tools using real and simulated datasets of cattle, pig, and mouse.

    <summary>While I was writing this,</summary>
    I tried looking for a :cattle: emoji but I was only able to come up with a :cow: emoji.
    <br>
    From there, I discovered that cows are <b>female cattle</b>.
    <br>
    I thought they were different animals. i hope i get a free pass on this. please. i studied computer science if that helps.
